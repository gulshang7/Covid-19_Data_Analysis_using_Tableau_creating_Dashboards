3) What are the total number of Confirmed cases in India?
4) What are the total number of Recovered cases in India?
5) Can we Forecast Trend-Line for COVID - 19?
6) Find the Highest Death rates in International Level.
7) Find the Least Death rates.
8) Can we find the variation in COVID - 19 Cases around the World.
9) Can we forecast the sheet for future and reference.
